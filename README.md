# C++ Modernes

* This was intiallly a John Bandela [sources](https://github.com/google/cpp-from-the-sky-down) *fork* motivated from his [CPP Con19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSxo85L2lC0) talk on Dynamic Polymorphism without inheritance

* However by the far, it has became my first *formal* introduction to the so called *Modern* C++ technics applied to the 11,14,17 language revisions

* My C++ understanding has been deeply re-learned from that perspective. This includes the view/scope of the [**SOLID** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles given by R.C. Martin

* Everything beyond the *c++98* and the *tr1* is mainly grouped on the **Basics** directory entry. Sources there, sometimes have the *backporting* taste behind; Whenever be possible, the patterns/examples have been cross-compiled/tested/verified on the PowerPC g++4.2 toolchain; All the stuff has been packaged on the *back-porting-c++98* entry

* **CMake** tool is used everywhere, if the *CMakeLists.txt* is not provided ... is the first thing to be written

* More specific entries are oriented by themes (like the *FSMs* case)

* Obviously the material given by Sean Parent, Fedor Pikus and Scott Meyers have its own stuff
