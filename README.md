# C++ Modernes

This was intiallly a John Bandela sources fork motivated from his last CPPCon19 conference on Dynamic Polymorphism without inheritance

However by the far, it's my first *formal* introduction to the Modern C++ technics, applied to the 11,14,17 languages

All the known stuff must be re-learned from that perspective, including the **SOLID** principles given by R.C. Martin

The **Basics** on beyond c++98 and the tr1 are mainly grouped on the *PreLearning* directory entry. Having in mind the technics where the backport are still feasible.  

More specific entries are deployed by themes (like the *FSMs* case)

Sean Parent and Scott Meyers have its own stuff obviously
