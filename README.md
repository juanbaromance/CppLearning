# C++ Modernes

This was intiallly a John Bandela [sources](https://github.com/google/cpp-from-the-sky-down) fork motivated from his last CPPCon19 [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSxo85L2lC0) on Dynamic Polymorphism without inheritance

However by the far, it's my first *formal* introduction to the *modern* C++ technics, applied to the 11,14,17 languages

My known stuff must be re-learned from that perspective, including the **SOLID** principles given by R.C. Martin

Everything beyond the c++98 and the tr1 are mainly grouped on the **Basics** directory entry. Sources there, sometimes have the *backporting* taste behind.

More specific entries are deployed by themes (like the *FSMs* case)

Sean Parent and Scott Meyers have its own stuff obviously
