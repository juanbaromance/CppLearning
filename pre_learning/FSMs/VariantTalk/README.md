# Example code for my talk "std::variant and the Power of Pattern Matching"

This repository contains the example code shown in my presentation "std::variant and the power of pattern matching". To build, a C++ 17 compatible compiler is required. I have tested it on the following compilers:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.8.9)
- clang 7.0.0 (with libc++)

In addition, the library SFML is required. I tested versions 2.4 and 2.5.
On Mac OS, you can install it via homebrew:

```
brew install sfml
```

You can also find the slides for my presentation in the `slides` directory.

All the code in this repository is shared under the MIT license (see `LICENSE`).

## Blog post

I wrote a [guest post for Bartek's coding blog](https://www.bfilipek.com/2019/06/fsm-variant-game.html), which focuses specifically on the state machine/space game part of this talk.
